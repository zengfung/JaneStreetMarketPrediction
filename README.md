In this project, the goal is to predict the future return values of market shares based on their share prices from a time series of 130 points. The dataset is obtained from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/overview) competition.

The following are some possible steps to achieve such goals:

1. Denoising

    * Soft Thresholding using Wavelet Packet Transforms

2. Machine Learning models used:

   * Decision Trees (CART)
   * Linear Discriminant Analysis
   * k-Nearest Neighbors
   * Artificial Neural Network
   * Convolutional Neural Network
